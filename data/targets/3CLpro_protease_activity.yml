target: "3CLpro protease activity"
description: >
  3CLpro (main protease, M-PRO, etc) is a viral cysteine protease
  responsible for maturation of the viral polyprotein, necessary for
  infection. Target of many drug discovery campaigns. 3CLpro is an
  obligate dimer, although many drug design efforts just use a monomer
  structure.
protein:
  - Mpro
therapeutic: small molecule
